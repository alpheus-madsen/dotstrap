Alphy's Dotfile Collection
--------------------------

These are Alphy's favorite settings for his work environment.  This includes a "dotstrip.sh" dotfile
bootstrap script that stores the default settings of a given computer, and symlinks to my settings.

Many of these settings are empty, either in anticipation of future customization, or to pre-empt
certain settings files.  (Emacs, for example, has three possible customization files; I include all
three possibilities, to ensure that two of the files don't interfere with the directory-based one.)
