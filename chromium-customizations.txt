Change Settings:
----------------

1. Settings -> Show Advanced Settings -> Downloads -> Check "Always ask me where to save files."

2. Settings -> Show Advanced Settings ->  -> "Show my windows and tabs from last time"

3. Settings -> On Startup -> Select "Continue where you left off"

4. (Consider) Settings -> Show Advanced Settings -> System -> Uncheck "Continue running background apps when Chromium is closed"

Check other settings to see if they are to my liking...


Plugins to Install:
-------------------

Flash (technically an OS installation...and hold on to you hats, because it's a bumpy ride!  Watch out for pepperflashplugin--nonfree)

Apps -> Search for "AdBlock Plus"

Apps -> Search for "Clear Cache" (by Benjamin Bojko)
